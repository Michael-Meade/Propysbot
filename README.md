# Propysbot
Botnet Javascript in Server Proxy

# about
Moving from an environment that specifically infects a
JavaScript file, we decided that the best way to create the
botnet would be if bots did "motu proprio", it means, not a
forced man in the middle, but chosen by themselves. Hereby
we decided to focus on the TOR network and Proxy servers
used on the Internet.


# Starting
*1: VPS on Linux
*2: Downloads and install Squid.
*3: 

# Logic
1) Download the file from its original location.
2) Save it to a temporary location.
3) Add the JavaScript infection code at the end of the
JavaScript file.
4) Make that file has an expiration date of 3,000 days.
5) Deliver to the clients the new created JavaScript file.
